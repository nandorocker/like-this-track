We only use pnpm, never npm.

Don't create new instruction markdown files without being requested.

Alfred scripts are always executed starting from the directory where they are located. We don't need to use absolute paths in the plist file.

Never include my username in any scripts or paths.

All files in the /src directory should be files that are used by the Alfred workflow. Do not include any files that are not used by the workflow.

We keep tests in the /tests directory.
